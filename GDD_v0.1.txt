# Hullforge - Game Concept Document

## Overview

**Title:** Hullforge  
**Genre:** Top-down bullet-hell survival + modular ship-building incremental  
**Core Fantasy:** Start as a tiny escape pod in a hostile rift-filled space sector. Survive endless waves of corrupted enemies and asteroids by personally piloting and manually building your ship piece-by-piece between waves. Your ship physically grows, changes handling, and becomes a chaotic franken-monster of guns, armor, and exotic modules. Every bullet can rip modules off your hull—making survival tense and rebuilds meaningful.

**Tagline:** Build it. Fly it. Lose it. Rebuild it bigger.

**Inspiration Blend:**
- Asteroids-style physics & shooting
- Vampire Survivors incremental power fantasy
- Space Engineers / From the Depths modular building
- Touhou / Geometry Wars bullet-hell density in late game

## Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Wave Phase**  
   - Top-down Asteroids-style controls: thrust, rotate, inertia-based movement.  
   - You pilot the Core Pod / growing ship.  
   - Enemies spawn in waves: drone swarms, fighters, corrupted capital ships, asteroid fields.  
   - They fire dense, patterned bullet-hell attacks.  
   - Asteroids tumble in; some are corrupted and shoot back.  
   - Your attached modules fire automatically (PDCs, missiles, etc.).  
   - You manually aim/fire the Core Cannon (primary weapon) + overcharge specials.  
   - Enemy bullets & collisions **destroy individual modules** — armor plates shear off, turrets explode, engines go dark.  
   - Kills drop **Salvage** (instant currency) + **Data Shards** (meta currency).  
   - Mid-wave Salvage pickups let you hot-buy & attach new modules on the fly (risky but powerful).

2. **Repair / Rebuild Phase** (20–40 seconds after surviving wave)  
   - Ship floats in a glowing dry-dock view.  
   - Two options:  
     a. **Quick Repair** — Spend Scrap/Energy to restore all lost modules to original positions (fast, safe, momentum-preserving).  
     b. **Manual Rebuild** — Free. Full drag-and-drop: reposition surviving modules, rotate them, attach newly bought ones, experiment with crazy layouts.  
   - Ship visually updates in real-time — engines glow, armor plates snap on, turrets spin up.

3. **Next Wave** — Bigger, faster, denser bullet patterns, higher HP enemies.

4. **Death** → **Research Bay** (hub)  
   - Spend Data Shards on permanent progression tree.  
   - Unlock new module types, global stat buffs, exotic Rifttech.

## Ship Building & Module System

### Starting Piece
- **Core Pod** — small glowing hub with basic thrust & single forward shot.

### Module Categories & Placement Rules
- **Nose / Forward** — Heavy armor, railguns, beam emitters (big damage oomph)  
- **Sides / Flanks** — Point-Defense Cannons (PDC), missile racks, deflectors, shield arcs  
- **Rear** — Engines (speed & thrust), afterburners, power plants  
- **Core / Internal** — Batteries, overcharge capacitors, shields, exotic modules (black-hole gens, self-repair nanites)

### Module Examples (early unlocks → late-game exotics)
1. Basic PDC Turret (auto-fires at small threats)  
2. Armor Plate (absorbs hits, high HP)  
3. Rear Ion Engine (increases thrust & top speed)  
4. Forward Railgun (charged piercing shot)  
5. Energy Shield Arc (blocks one sector)  
6. Missile Pod (homing salvo)  
7. Fractal Mirror Plating (reflects bullets back at enemies)  
8. Singularity Bomb Bay (deploys mini black holes that suck in projectiles)  
9. Adaptive Camo Hull (temporarily reduces enemy targeting priority)  
10. Self-Replicating Drone Bay (spawns friendly auto-targeting drones)

### Physics & Feel Implications
- More mass (modules) → slower turn rate, higher inertia  
- Rear engines → faster acceleration & boost  
- Lost engines → crippled mobility  
- Lost PDCs → vulnerable flanks become bullet magnets  
- Balanced builds feel snappy and agile; overbuilt monsters feel like sluggish flying fortresses  
- Edge case: minimal viable builds (glass cannon speed demons) vs. maximum mass tanks

## Progression & Meta Systems

### In-Run Currency
- **Salvage** — Dropped on kill, used for mid-wave purchases & rebuilds  
- **Energy Cores** — Rare drop, used for Quick Repair or high-cost/exotic modules

### Meta Currency
- **Data Shards** — Earned every run (scales with wave depth & performance), spent in Research Bay

### Research Bay Tree (130+ nodes, four main branches + late-game Rifttech)
- **Offense** — Gun damage, fire rate, projectile behaviors (split, bounce, chain, homing)  
- **Defense** — Module HP, repair efficiency, shield strength, auto-repair chance  
- **Mobility** — Thrust power, turn rate, inertia dampening, emergency boost  
- **Exotic / Rifttech** — Reality-bending modules (bullet-to-ammo conversion, self-replication, time-slow fields, enemy bullet reflection)

Global upgrades include: Core HP, Salvage per kill multiplier, drop chance buffs, max module slots, starting energy, etc.

## Campaign & Narrative

- **Structure:** 8 Cycles (chapters), each containing 6–8 escalating waves  
- **Finale:** Cycle 8 ends with a rift-collapse mega-boss that warps the arena and forces mid-fight rebuilds under extreme pressure  
- **Delivery:** Salvaged **ship logs** (short holo-text snippets) that unlock progressively  
- **Milestone unlocks:** First shield module, surviving wave 15, maxing an exotic branch, etc.  
- **Story Arc:** A lone pilot scavenging in a dying convoy discovers the rift is sentient and parasitic—feeding on ships and pilots. Themes of isolation, hubris, survival, and power corruption.  
- **Endings (4 variants):**  
  1. Heroic sacrifice — seal the rift at the cost of the ship  
  2. Void ascension — become the new rift entity  
  3. Escape vector — flee with forbidden tech  
  4. Chaos eternal — turn the sector into permanent fractal fireworks

## Late-Game Power Fantasy

- Ship evolves into a 40+ module asymmetric nightmare (one flank a fortress of armor & railguns, the other a bristling missile & PDC death blossom)  
- Visual chaos: splitting plasma trails, PDC grids vaporizing incoming bullets, black holes devouring formations, screen-shake + bloom overload  
- Bullet density reaches late Touhou levels, but half the screen becomes your own friendly explosion symphony  
- Handling choice: twitchy glass-cannon speed demon or lumbering god-machine — entirely player-driven

## Technical & Art Scope Notes

- **Modular assets:** 15–20 base hull pieces (rotate, flip, recolor for variants)  
- **Destruction:** VFX + “broken/dark” module states  
- **Background:** Procedural starfield + nebula layers (low effort, high impact)  
- **Enemies:** 8–10 kitbashable hull types  
- **Overall:** Very friendly art budget — emphasis on particles, bloom, screen effects, and modular reuse for maximum “whoa” factor

## Why It Stands Out

- You **are** the ship — feel every lost module in your handling, every rebuild in your power  
- Real risk/reward: one brutal wave can strip you naked; one clever rebuild can break the game  
- Incremental growth stays hands-on — no auto-pilot; you’re always dodging, shooting, and piloting  
- Proper finite campaign with narrative payoff + multiple endings (not pure endless mode)  
- Fresh hybrid feel: Asteroids piloting + Vampire Survivors progression + real modular ship consequences

**Current Development Mood:** Hyped. This feels like the complete package.
