# Hullforge - Development Roadmap

No hard deadlines — progress at your own pace. Focus is on building the core fantasy step by step.

## Milestone 0.1 - Core Flight & Combat Loop
- Basic ship (Core Pod) in a playable level
- Asteroids-style controls: thrust, rotate, inertia-based movement
- Manual aiming & firing Core Cannon
- Simple resource pickup (Salvage orbs from rocks/enemies)
- Basic asteroids/rocks spawning and colliding
- At least one enemy type spawning + shooting back
- **Goal:** Survive a short chaotic minute or two and feel the piloting/shooting loop

## Milestone 0.2 - In-Run Progression & Upgrades
- Salvage as in-run currency
- Basic shop/hot-buy system (spend Salvage mid-wave or between waves to attach simple modules)
- Research Bay / persistent upgrade tree (spend Data Shards on global buffs, new module unlocks)
- Simple wave structure (survive → short rebuild/upgrade window → next wave)

## Milestone 0.3 - Minimal Ship Builder
- Drag-and-drop ship builder interface
- Core Pod + 3–5 basic module types (e.g., PDC turret, armor plate, engine, railgun)
- Grid snapping, rotation, attach/detach
- Deploy built ship into gameplay
- Visual feedback: modules snap on, glow, update ship stats/handling in real-time

## Milestone 0.4 - Menus & UI Basics
- Title screen
- Main menu (New Game, Continue, Settings, Quit)
- Basic settings (volume, controls remap if needed)
- In-game pause menu
- HUD showing health, salvage, wave count, etc.

## Milestone 0.5 - Save & Load System
- Persistent save for Research Bay unlocks / Data Shards
- Save/load run progress (if we want mid-campaign saves)
- Basic profile or slot system

## Milestone 0.6 - Story & Narrative Elements
- Ship log snippets (short text/holo popups on milestones)
- Basic campaign structure (Cycles/chapters placeholder)
- Multiple ending stubs (text-only for now)

## Milestone 0.7 - Audio (Music & Sound)
- Placeholder/main tracks for gameplay, menus, rebuild phase
- Core sound effects: shooting, explosions, module attach/destroy, pickup, thrust

## Milestone 0.8 - Module Expansion & Polish
- More module types (shields, missiles, exotics)
- Destruction VFX/states (broken modules, dark engines)
- Better enemy variety & bullet patterns
- Particle & bloom effects for power fantasy
- Handling tweaks (mass/inertia feel)

## Milestone 0.9 - Bug Fixing & Demo Prep
- Playtesting & bug hunt
- Balance pass on waves, salvage economy, module costs
- Export demo build (web or Windows for sharing)

## Milestone 1.0 - Release Candidate
- Final polish round
- Export final build
- (Optional) itch.io / jam submission prep
